# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### _LitTunes_

**LitTunes** is an application that creates custom playlists for readers, tailoring song recommendations to suit a specified book, characters, or keywords using the Spotify API.

_Interactivity and Engagement:_ The functionality of the app depends on user participation. Users will have control over several metrics for playlist generation (book title or character name, desired moods, genres, and keywords).

_Accessibility:_ The design will prioritize easy navigation and control. The platform will also strive to abide by [Spotify's accessibility guide for developers](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/accessibility), maintaining awareness of alt text, color contrast, and more.

_Information:_ Not applicable. LitTunes is not an informational application.

![title for sketch1](public/assets/proposal/LitTunesSketch.jpg)
_Left: Prompt page; contains various fields for users to specify their playlist features_
_Right: Playlist generation results; reiteration of playlist features and vertical list of recommended tracks_

### _FableFrame_

**FableFrame** is a tool aimed at helping authors and storytellers organize and visualize the details of their characters and settings, making the manuscript development process more structured and accessible.

_Interactivity and Engagement:_ At it's based level the platform will allow users to create character and setting profiles, with the ability to enter text and add images and links. Future iterations might explore ways to link characters, drag-and-drop functionality, etc.

_Accessibility:_ FableFrame will be designed with a focus on readability and ease of use, possibly including options for changing text size and background colors to accommodate different visual preferences. As a form of a CMS, organization will be key, and the interface will need to be as straightforward as possible.

_Information:_ The information FableFrame showcases depends on content entered by the user, but the interface will at least feature the essential sections for character and setting design. Users will be able to access both general and detail views of their information, reducing information-overload and ensuring only the necessary information is provided at a given time.

![title for sketch1](public/assets/proposal/FableFrameSketch.jpg)
_Top Left: Main page; shows sortable/filter-able list of created subpages (characters and settings); navigation panel allows user to access pages specifically for characters or settings_
_Bottom Left: Alternate main page; user can toggle between list and grid view_
_Right: Example of a character page, containing sections dedicated to general information, appearance, personality, etc. Setting pages would be similar, but with different sections._

### _Mealwise_

**Mealwise** is designed to provide users with personalized recipe recommendations and nutritional information by leveraging the Spoonacular API. The project aims to help users discover new meals based on their dietary preferences and what ingredients they have on hand.

_Interactivity and Engagement:_ With the "What's in my fridge" feature, users will be able to input specific ingredientsto receive recipe suggestions, creating a dynamic and personalized experience.

_Accessibility:_ The design will focus on photos and text, screen reader compatibility, and simple, intuitive navigation to ensure that the website is accessible to users with varying abilities.

_Information:_ The site will feature general browsing and a recipe detail view. It will display thorough breakdowns of recipes, including ingredients, cooking steps, nutritional information, and more.

![title for sketch1](public/assets/proposal/MealwiseSketch.jpg)
_Top Left: Homepage; choice between general recipe search and searching for recipes with specific ingredients/"What's in my fridge" (in hindsight, would not separate these options, just add filtering to general search)_
_Top Right: General recipe search/browsing page_
_Bottom Left: "What's in my fridge" page; user enters specific ingredients they want recipes for_
_Bottom Right: Recipe page; includes image, name, description, ingredients, steps, etc._

## Feedback Summary

For LitTunes, the feedback generally focused on refining the mechanism of playlist creation to ensure relevance and user engagement. Cella found the initial book-centric playlist idea feasible with the Spotify API. Abby and Sapna were intrigued by customizing playlists based on detailed criteria like keywords or book characteristics. Michael questioned the basis for song recommendations and the functionality for saving playlists. Sanjna cautioned against using "vibes" due to their complexity, suggesting sticking with moods. Kennion favored the idea of recommending lyric-free music to accompany reading, considering it a unique angle that could enhance the reading experience.

FableFrame received suggestions related to enhancing the story development tools and information management. Cella advised considering unique interactions or elements that differentiate it from standard content management systems. Abby viewed it as beneficial for organizational purposes and gaining a high-level view of the narrative. Michael proposed a feature to visualize character connections and prevent out-of-character behaviors, which might be complex but intriguing. Sapna saw its utility for authors and their collaborators, like editors and illustrators. Kennion liked it for practicing information architecture and suggested integrating interactive elements like images and sounds through an LLM API.

For Mealwise, the feedback centered on enhancing user interaction and personalization. Cella suggested incorporating appealing designs, especially around the "what's in my fridge" feature. Abby liked the idea of saving recipes and highlighted the fridge feature, while Michael appreciated the meal recommendation aspect. Sapna found the concept useful for managing leftover ingredients. Sanjna recommended focusing on creating a personal recipe book for users and suggested filtering options to refine recipe searches. Kennion emphasized the potential of integrating an LLM API to explore what could be made from available ingredients, suggesting that this aspect might introduce complexity but could be enjoyable.

## Feedback Digestion

I have decided to develop LitTunes, as I believe it’s the most interactive and interesting project of the three, both for users and myself as the developer.

While there was some concern around using "vibes" as a metric by which users could craft their playlist, I do believe it's doable. A more accurate term would likely be "keywords", which can be searched for in existing playlist titles and descriptions; ["getting" playlists by field is supported by the Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlist), and these can then be searched for the specified keyword(s). This added layer of recommendation logic not only seems viable, but also necessary for improving the relevancy of returned songs. I do not expect genre and mood to provide a fine enough filter for ensuring songs have the appropriate message or subject matter.

I especially appreciate Kennion’s point about recommending instrumental songs that could be listened to _while_ reading. That would definitely be a useful setting for users to toggle on and off, depending on their intentions for the playlist and/or personal preference. I'm not someone who listens to music while reading, but can certainly see how lyric-free tracks would be less distracting and potentially more immersive. "Instrumental" is listed as one of Spotify's genres, so this should be fairly simple to filter for.

Michael's question around saving the generated playlist was also something that had crossed my mind but not fully looked into. A quick search shows that [creating an empty playlist for a user](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/create-playlist) and [saving tracks to it](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/add-tracks-to-playlist) is also possible with the API. To implement this, the user would need to sign into their Spotify account. I wonder if it would be best to have users sign in upfront in order to use the app, or wait until they make the decision to save the playlist to prompt sign-in. An immediate benefit of the second approach would be leaving the playlist-creation aspect of the app accessible to non-Spotify users, but I'll have to give this more thought.
